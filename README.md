# LogME
LogME: Practical Assessment of Pre-trained Models for Transfer Learning.

# Experimental results

We extensively validate the generality and superior performance of LogME on 14 pre-trained models and 17 downstream tasks, covering various pre-trained models (supervised pre-trained and unsupervised pre-trained), downstream tasks (classification and regression), and modalities (vision and language). Check the paper for all the results.

## Computer vision

9 datasets and 10 pre-trained models. LogME is a reasonably good indicator for transfer performance.

## NLP

7 tasks and 4 pre-trained models. LogME is a good indicator for transfer performance.

# Speedup

LogME provides a dramatic speedup for assessing pre-trained models. The speedup comes from two aspects:

- LogME does not need hyper-parameter tuning whereas vanilla fine-tuning requires extensive hyper-parameter tuning.
- We designed a fast algorithm to further speedup the computation of LogME.
